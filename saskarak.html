<h2>Attack</h2>
<p>Mantis shrimps have two methods of attack; they can be<b>spearers</b> or <b>smashers.</b></p>
<p>They strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their claws at the prey, and can cause serious damage on victims larger than themselves.
</p>
  <h3>Eyesight</h3>
  <p>Their eyes are mounted on mobile stalks and constantly move about independently of each other. They are considered to be the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom.</p>
  <p>The mantis shrimp has such good eyes that it can perceive both polarized light, and color vision outside the normal visual spectrum.</p>
